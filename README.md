# CELEBRARE
This project is a dynamic, web-based image editor built with a "frosted glass" UI and an animated snowfall background. It uses Swiper.js to create a swipeable image carousel, allowing users to add, drag, edit, and style text elements on each slide. The entire application is built with vanilla HTML, CSS (backdrop-filter), and JavaScript.
